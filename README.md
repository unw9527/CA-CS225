# CS225 PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT

Below are two programming assignments in CS225 taken with Prof. Schewe in Spring 2021. We implemented a medical system, and details including how to use and the way we implemented can be found in two README files in two folders separately.

## NOTICE

If you are students taking CS225 with Prof. Schewe, **MAKE SURE** that you write your own code. **DO NOT** copy the code here without proper citation. We are **NOT** responsible for any behaviors you conduct that violate the academic integrity regulations.
